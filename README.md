# DEI Project Badging

## About DEI Project Badging

The DEI Project Badging Initiative is a [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) that awards badges to open-source projects that demonstrate diversity and inclusion. This initiative promotes leadership, self-reflection, and self-improvement on issues critical to building the Internet as a social good.

The DEI project badges help open source project maintainers showcase their ongoing commitment to improving and supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

## How does DEI Project Badging work?

- Open Source projects submit their project repository containing a DEI.md file. Check out what a DEI.md file entails and how to create one [here](https://github.com/badging/badging/blob/main/DEI.md).

- The project badging scanner bot will search through the DEI.md file in the specified repository for evidence of required metrics.

- Once the scan is complete, the project will receive a markdown snippet that can be included in the README.md as an image of the DEI Project Badge earned.

- Upon the conclusion of each badging level, the project receives an inclusive language report on how to improve its DEI efforts in order to apply for and earn the next badging level.
