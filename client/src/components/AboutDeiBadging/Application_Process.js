        <h3>Self-Assessment and Documentation:</h3>
        <p>
          Before applying for a CHAOSS Project DEI Badge, maintainers or project admins are
          encouraged to conduct a self-assessment of their project&#39;s DEI
          efforts based on the following <strong>CHAOSS DEI metrics:</strong>{" "}
          Project Access, Inclusive Leadership, Communication Transparency, and
          Newcomer Experience. After the reflective process, maintainers can
          document how the project attends to and prioritizes DEI around these
          areas in a markdown file called the <a href="https://github.com/badging/badging/blob/main/Template.DEI.md">DEI.md file</a>. This
          DEI.md file should exist within the project&#39;s repository for easy
          feedback from the community. A guide for putting together your DEI.md file is avaialble through the <a href="https://github.com/badging/badging/blob/main/Guide.DEI.md">DEI.md Guide</a>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Badging Application:</h3>
        <p>
          Once the DEI.md file is published and publicly available, project
          owners can proceed to <a href="https://badging.chaoss.community/badge">apply here</a>. The applicant must be a project owner and the repository that holds the DEI.md file must be specified.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Badging Evaluation:</h3>
        <p>
          The review follows an automated process in which a CHAOSS bot scans
          the project repository for the presence of a DEI.md file. The bot will
          review the DEI.md file for relevant information provided by the
          maintainer and its alignment with the CHAOSS DEI metrics stated in the
          <a href="https://github.com/badging/badging/blob/main/Template.DEI.md">DEI.md template</a> to determine eligibility for the
          badge. Upon successful review of the DEI.md file, a project badge will
          be issued. The four CHAOSS metrics used in the DEI.md file include:
        </p>
        <ul className='bullet-list'>
          <li>Project Access</li>
          <li>Inclusive Leadership </li>
          <li>Communication Transparency</li>
          <li>Newcomer Experience</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Recognition and Badging:</h3>
        <p>
          Projects that meet the established criteria will receive the
          CHAOSS DEI Project Badge, which can be prominently displayed on the
          project&#39;s website, documentation, or other relevant platforms. The
          badge signifies the project&#39;s commitment to DEI and highlights its
          attention to DEI best practices.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Continued Engagement:</h3>
        <p>
          Once the badging process is completed, you can re-apply for a project badge -- we recommend after about a year. We will
          also be developing CHAOSS Project Badges for Silver, Gold, and Platnium levels in the future that include new CHAOSS metrics.
