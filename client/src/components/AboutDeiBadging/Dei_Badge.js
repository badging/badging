          CHAOSS DEI Project Badging  currently offers one badge
          level: Bronze. As the project evolves, it is our intention to include
          additional CHAOSS metrics in the DEI.md file as indicators of Silver,
          Gold, and Platinum level badges. CHAOSS DEI Project Badging is intended to follow an incremental approach that requires
          the presence of one badge to apply for the next and an understanding
          of the criteria associated with each badge level. This will enable
          applicants to showcase their commitment, dedication, and consistent
          efforts in meeting the evolving DEI standards for each badge.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h3>Bronze Badge</h3>
          <p>
            The bronze badge is the first-level badge. The badge primarily
            focuses on how the project metrics provided in the DEI.md file meet
            the basic requirements according to the CHAOSS DEI metrics.
          </p>
          <h4>Criteria:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Having a DEI.md file in your project repository</li>
            <li>The presence of required metrics headers in the DEI.md file</li>
            <li>
              The presence of details on how the project attends to the four
              metrics: Project Access, Inclusive Leadership, Communication
              Transparency, and Newcomer Experiences.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Silver, Gold, and Platinum Badges will be coming soon. Please join us
            in our open and collaborative conversations when considering what
            CHAOSS metrics would be best suited as indicators of these badges.

					<h3>Silver Badge</h3>
					<p>
						Building upon the foundation established with the Bronze badge,

						needs of the project according to CHAOSS metrics. One can only apply
						for a Silver badge after earning the Bronze badge and receiving the
						DEI scan report.
