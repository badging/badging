      <p>
        The DEI.md file is an essential component of CHAOSS DEI Project
        Badging. It serves as a benchmark for open source projects to
        openly acknowledge and showcase their dedication to diversity, equity,
        and inclusion (DEI).
      </p>

      <p>
        The DEI.md file can be used to explicitly express and
        self-reflect on their project&#39;s approach to DEI. Community members are
        encouraged to include relevant content that reflects their project&#39;s
        specific approaches and initiatives regarding diversity, equity, and
        inclusion within the DEI.md file. This may include outlining strategies,
        policies, and practices to foster a welcoming environment for all
        contributors.
      </p>

          If an organizational-level folder is not available, place the DEI.md
          file in a community repository
