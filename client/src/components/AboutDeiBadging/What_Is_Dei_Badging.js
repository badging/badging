        CHAOSS DEI Project Badging is an initiative developed 
              by the CHAOSS project to recognize open source 
              projects that exemplify best practices for diversity, 
              equity, and inclusion (DEI) work within their 
              respective communities. The initiative uses 
              CHAOSS DEI metrics as a benchmark to reflect 
              on DEI efforts in an open source project. 
              All CHAOSS DEI metrics are developed in an 
              open and collaborative setting.
